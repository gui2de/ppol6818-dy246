## Experimental Design Bio 
### January 29, 2025 

Daija is a first year MIDP student at McCourt facing her STATA fears by taking Experimental Design. 
She looks forward to applying the skills learned in this course during her summer internship. Her favorite activities outside of research are: 
* reading the works of Black Studies scholars 
* doing yoga 
* singing in the car 
* swimming 
* spending time in the archives
Daija was introduced to archival research as a transcriber/translator for [Keywords for Black Louisiana ](https://docs.k4bl.org/about/) 
Our project is apart of a larger ecosystem of digital humanities labs housed under the collective LifexCode:
